This is a chess game implemented using Qt to provide a satisfying interface.
The program allows two players to take turns playing chess on the same screen, using an object-oriented approach.


### affichage folder
This folder contains the code to manage the display of the chessboard and control it using Qt functionalities.


### lib folder
This folder defines the behavior of each chess piece.
It also establishes the relationships and rules governing the interactions between the pieces and the chessboard.

### piece folder
This folder contains the images of the chess pieces (both black and white) used in the game.

## How does it work?
1. Start this project in QT Creator
* A window will appear, and you can start a chess game with a friend.

2. Each player should choose a color.
* The white player starts the game.

3. To use a piece, first click on the piece, then on the square where you want to put the piece.
* Take turns playing with your friend until you receive the message "Checkmate!" that indicates the end of the game.
