This is a chess game implemented to work in QT in order to have a satisfying interface.  
This programme allows two playerss to play chess in turn on the same screen as we used an oriented-object approach.

### affichage folder
This folder allows us to set the display of the chessboard and control it with QT functionalities.

### lib folder
This folder contains the behaviour that should be assigned to each piece of the chess game. 
In addition, the relationhip and the rules between each piece and the chessboard are also set in this folder.

### piece folder
This folder contains the different pieces's pictures that are implemented in the chessboard (black and white).

## How does it works?
1. Start this project in QT Creator
* A window will appear, and you can start a chess game with a friend.

2. Each player should choose a color.
* The white player starts the game.

3. To use a piece, click first on the piece, then on the case where you want to put the piece.
* Play in turn with your friend until you receive the message "Checkmate!" that indicates the end of the game.
